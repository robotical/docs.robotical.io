Scratch is the simplest and easiest way to start programming your Marty,
if you're new to programming. The interface lets you graphically build up
a program from blocks. Marty can work both with Scratch 3 as well as 
Scratch X. 

If you are new to Marty and Scratch it is recommended you use Scratch 3.
