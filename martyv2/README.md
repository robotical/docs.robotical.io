# MartyV2 Docs Site Structure

The skeleton for the Marty V2 Docs website is as follows:

## NOTE: I WILL ADD FOLDER STRUCTURE/IMAGE

There is an initial index.html at the root repository which is the main landing page for the user for the Marty V2 material of the website. There is a blue button at the left of the main text titled 'Marty V1 Docs' which provides a link to the old Marty V1 website.

The layout of the website is similar to the older version for consistency, however, the previous subsections:
- Standard Setup with Just Rick
- RaspberryPi in head with Rick
- Simulation

are now replaced with:
- Bluetooth to RIC
- Marty App

These new sections provides links to documentations/guides on the Scratch interface for Bluetooth to RIC and information about the Marty App that's implemented using React Native respectively.
