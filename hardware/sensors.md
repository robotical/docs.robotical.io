On-Board Sensors
----------------

[Rick](/hardware/rick) has some integrated sensors that can be accessed through it's [API](/hardware/sicket-api)

Acclerometer
: [MMA8452Q 3-axis, 12/8 bit accelerometer](https://public.robotical.io/Datasheets/MMA8452QT.pdf) connected on the 1st I<sup>2</sup>C bus.
By convention, the axes of the accelerometer are re-mapped in the API from their manufacturer assignments onto the standard robot frame of reference
(x forward, y laterally left, z vertically up). These are marked on the PCB.

Motor Current (*"Force"*) Sensors
: A 0.1 Î© 1206 resistor (Schematic ref. R7 to R14) is attached from the Servo low-side to ground, and then to a GPIO on U1
for all motor channels *except* channel 9 (used for the Eyes). This permits motor current sensing, as a proxy for exertion/force/torque.


Add-On Sensors
==============

**Note that** add-ons such as the [Raspberry Pi Camera](https://robotical.io/shop/sku/20) don't interact with Rick
so aren't documented here.
